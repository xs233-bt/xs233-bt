### 🏗️ Current Projects  

- **📊 IBKR Real-Time Stock Data Streaming & Portfolio Monitoring**  
  Engineered a **real-time market data pipeline** leveraging the **IBKR API** and **Apache Kafka** to stream live quotes (e.g., TSLA, NVDA, AAPL).  
  Built **Python producers and consumers** to capture and process tick-level data, storing it efficiently in **AWS S3** for historical analysis.  
  Utilized **DuckDB** for fast local analytics and developed an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** to visualize portfolio performance, exposure, and trade signals in real time.  

- **🏗️ Modern Data Lakehouse with Apache Iceberg**  
  Designed and implemented a **schema-evolving data warehouse** on AWS using **S3 + Glue + Athena + Iceberg**, enabling versioned, ACID-compliant datasets.  
  Orchestrated **Airflow-based ingestion and transformation pipelines**, and modeled analytical layers using **dbt** and **Redshift Spectrum**.  
  Integrated **AWS Glue Data Quality** checks and **SQLMesh backfill automation** to maintain data accuracy, lineage, and reproducibility across the medallion architecture.  
 
- **📧 Automated Airflow Reporting via SSH & SMTP**  
  Developed a **Python-based ETL pipeline** that securely connects to remote databases through **SSH tunneling**, extracts and transforms daily business data, and emails formatted reports to stakeholders.  
  The workflow was fully orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**, enabling scheduled automation, retry handling, and dependency tracking.
