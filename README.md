### 🏗️ Current Projects  


### 🔹 IBKR Options Strategy Agent

**Phase I – Completed**

A real-time options analytics engine built in **Python**, leveraging **ib_insync** to interface with the **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API**. Live option chain data is ingested at near tick-level granularity and streamed through **Apache Kafka** using custom Python producers and consumers. The pipeline computes core option metrics, including **Greeks**, **implied volatility**, **premium yield**, **probability metrics**, and **margin utilization**.

**Phase II – In Progress**

Processed option data is persisted in **Parquet** format on **AWS S3** (with local storage support) and queried using **DuckDB** for high-performance analytics. This phase focuses on generating **systematic strategy signals** for **covered calls**, **cash-secured puts**, and **vertical spreads**, with planned extensions for **historical backtesting**, **portfolio-level risk management**, and **automated trade execution**.

- **🏗️ Modern Data Lakehouse with Apache Iceberg**  
  Designed and implemented a **schema-evolving data warehouse** on AWS using **S3 + Glue + Athena + Iceberg**, enabling versioned, ACID-compliant datasets.  
  Orchestrated **Airflow-based ingestion and transformation pipelines**, and modeled analytical layers using **dbt** and **Redshift Spectrum**.  
  Integrated **AWS Glue Data Quality** checks and **SQLMesh backfill automation** to maintain data accuracy, lineage, and reproducibility across the medallion architecture.  
 
- **📧 Automated Airflow Reporting via SSH & SMTP**  
  Developed a **Python-based ETL pipeline** that securely connects to remote databases through **SSH tunneling**, extracts and transforms daily business data, and emails formatted reports to stakeholders.  
  The workflow was fully orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**, enabling scheduled automation, retry handling, and dependency tracking.  
  Technologies used include **pandas**, **sshtunnel**, **MySQL connector**, and **smtplib**, ensuring end-to-end automation without manual intervention.
