### 🏗️ Current Projects

---

### 🔹 IBKR Options Strategy Agent

**Phase I – Completed**

A real-time options analytics engine built in **Python**, leveraging **ib_insync** to interface with the **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API**. Live option chain data is ingested at near tick-level granularity and streamed through **Apache Kafka** using custom Python producers and consumers. The pipeline computes core option metrics, including **Greeks**, **implied volatility**, **premium yield**, **probability metrics**, and **margin utilization**.

**Phase II – In Progress**

Processed option data is persisted in **Parquet** format on **AWS S3** (with local storage support) and queried using **DuckDB** for high-performance analytics. This phase focuses on generating **systematic strategy signals** for **covered calls**, **cash-secured puts**, and **vertical spreads**, with planned extensions for **historical backtesting**, **portfolio-level risk management**, and **automated trade execution**.

### 🔹 Modern Data Lakehouse with Apache Iceberg

Designed and implemented a **schema-evolving data lakehouse** on **AWS**, using **S3 + Glue + Athena + Apache Iceberg**, enabling **versioned, ACID-compliant datasets**.

- Orchestrated **Airflow-based ingestion and transformation pipelines**
- Modeled analytical layers using **dbt** and **Redshift Spectrum**
- Integrated **AWS Glue Data Quality** checks and **SQLMesh backfill automation** to ensure data accuracy, lineage, and reproducibility across a medallion architecture

---

### 🔹 Automated Airflow Reporting via SSH & SMTP

Built a **Python-based ETL pipeline** that securely connects to remote databases via **SSH tunneling**, extracts and transforms daily business data, and distributes formatted reports to stakeholders via email.

- Fully orchestrated with **Apache Airflow** for scheduling, retries, and dependency management
- Implemented using **pandas**, **sshtunnel**, **MySQL Connector**, and **smtplib**
- Enabled reliable, end-to-end reporting automation with zero manual intervention
